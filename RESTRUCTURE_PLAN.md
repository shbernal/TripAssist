# AccessTrip — Restructure Plan: Stylized Demo + Real MVP

**Status:** proposed · **Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Owner:** shbernal

This plan splits the current single offline-simulation app into two deliverables in one
repo. They live in a pnpm **workspace** (for dependency isolation), **not** a full monorepo
migration — the MVP stays put at the repo root; only the demo is added as an isolated
workspace member. Both center on the same **initial-reservation** narrative (see AGENTS.md).

1. **`apps/demo`** — a **stylized, animation-heavy storytelling landing page** (static,
   **published to GitHub Pages** first; Vercel considered later). It tells Camille's story:
   an AI agent receives her itinerary, **calls the airport** for wheelchair assistance,
   **calls the hotel** for a roll-in shower, and Camille gets **two phone notifications**
   confirming both. No backend, no login — pure narrative. Faces are AI-generated (Codex),
   phone dialogue is voice-generated (ElevenLabs). Both generators live in the repo as tooling.
2. **The MVP** (stays at the repo **root** — `server/` + `web/` + `shared/`, unmoved) — the
   **real product**, centered on the same proactive initial-reservation flow and hardened to
   do _real_ work (real Vapi calls, real Claude agents, real open-data plugins, persistence).
   This is what we keep building after the hackathon.

> The MVP is **not relocated**. A workspace gives the demo its own dependency closure without
> touching the working app; an `apps/mvp` move + `packages/shared` extraction is a clean
> _post-hackathon_ step, deferred until shared code actually grows.
>
> **Disruption / re-planning** (the old center of gravity) is demoted to a _possible future_
> MVP feature — kept, but no longer what either deliverable leads with.

**Why a workspace (not two repos, not a full monorepo migration):** one `pnpm install` and
one repo, while `apps/demo` gets an **isolated dependency closure** (its heavy animation deps
never touch the MVP's server deploy). The MVP is left untouched at the root — zero import
rewrites, zero tsconfig-path juggling, no risk to the working app before the deadline. If the
demo ever needs the MVP's data shapes it can `import type` across a relative path; a true
`apps/mvp` + `packages/shared` split is a clean later move.

## 2. The demo — narrative & scene spec

**Persona:** Camille Moreau, 34, electric wheelchair (Permobil M3). **New narrative
(proactive setup, not a disruption):** the agent _organizes_ the trip and secures
accessibility _before_ departure.

Six scroll-pinned scenes. Each scene is a GSAP ScrollTrigger "pin" section; entering it
plays a Framer Motion / Lottie beat; scenes 3–4 auto-play their ElevenLabs call audio
when scrolled into view (with a mute/replay control — never autoplay sound without a
visible control).

| #   | Scene                 | What animates                                                                                                                                                  | Assets                                                         |
| --- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Hero**              | Camille portrait fades/parallax in; tagline types on; wheelchair + travel motifs drift.                                                                        | `faces/camille.png`                                            |
| 2   | **Itinerary arrives** | A boarding-pass / itinerary card flies into the AI agent's "inbox"; the agent avatar wakes (orb pulse); it parses steps into chips (flight, hotel, transfers). | `faces/ai-agent.png`                                           |
| 3   | **Call the airport**  | Split stage: AI orb ↔ CDG agent. Dialer animation → "connected". **Waveform + live captions** track the audio; a WCHC "confirmed" chip stamps in at the end.   | `faces/airport-agent.png`, `audio/airport-call/*`              |
| 4   | **Call the hotel**    | Same call stage → hotel receptionist. Tension beat: "104 has a bathtub" (⚠️ chip) → agent pushes → "room 210, roll-in shower" (✅).                            | `faces/hotel-receptionist.png`, `audio/hotel-call/*`           |
| 5   | **Two notifications** | Camille's phone (tilted, floating). Two iOS-style banners slide down in sequence with haptic-style bounce + checkmark Lottie: airport ✅ then hotel ✅.        | `faces/camille.png`, both `manifest.json.outcome.notification` |
| 6   | **Outro / CTA**       | Registry "ledger" seals (confirmations logged); tagline; button → the real MVP.                                                                                | —                                                              |

**Caption/animation sync:** every call `manifest.json` carries `lines[]` with `{start,
duration, caption, speaker}`. `useCallPlayer.ts` plays `conversation.mp3` and drives which
caption is active + which avatar is "speaking" purely from `currentTime`. No manual timing.

**Accessibility (non-negotiable — it's the product):**

- `prefers-reduced-motion`: replace scroll-pinned motion with instant states; still readable.
- Every call has a text transcript rendered in the DOM (captions are real text, not baked into audio), `aria-live="polite"` on the active caption.
- Audio is opt-in via a visible play/mute control; captions work with sound off.
- Full keyboard nav; focus-visible; WCAG AA contrast; alt text on every face.

---

## 3. Phone scripts & voice generation (delivered this turn)

- **Scripts:** `tooling/demo/scripts/airport-call.json`, `hotel-call.json`. French
  (matches persona). Each line has `speaker`, `text`, and a short `caption` for the UI.
  Each script ends with an `outcome` (status, reference, one-line summary, and the exact
  push-notification title/body used in scene 5).
- **Distinct voices per speaker:** the agent, the airport agent, and the hotel receptionist
  each use a different ElevenLabs voice. Voice IDs are read from env
  (`ELEVENLABS_VOICE_AGENT` / `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_AIRPORT` / `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_HOTEL`) with
  sensible public-voice fallbacks baked into the scripts, so it runs with just
  `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`.
- **Generator:** `tooling/demo/generate-voices.ts` → one MP3 per line, a stitched
  `conversation.mp3`, and a `manifest.json` with per-line start/duration (probed via
  `ffprobe`) for caption sync. `--only <id>` and `--no-stitch` flags.

**Run:**

```bash
node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs tooling/demo/generate-voices.ts          # both calls
node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs tooling/demo/generate-voices.ts --only hotel-call
```

## 4. Face generation (delivered this turn)

- **Manifest:** `tooling/demo/characters.json` — prompts for Camille, Julien, the airport
  agent, the hotel receptionist, and the AI-agent orb avatar; a shared photoreal `style`.
- **Generator:** `tooling/demo/generate-faces.ts` → PNGs into `apps/demo/public/faces/`
  via the Codex CLI image tool (ChatGPT OAuth, no API key). `--only a,b` and `--force`.

**Run:**

```bash
node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs tooling/demo/generate-faces.ts
node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs tooling/demo/generate-faces.ts --only camille,ai-agent --force
```

> Both generators write into `apps/demo/public/*`, which is `.gitignore`d for large media
> by default — regenerate on demand, or commit if we want deploy-without-keys. Decide in
> Phase 1.

## 5. The MVP — making it "real"

**Narrative:** the MVP now leads with the same **initial-reservation** story as the demo —
at booking time the agent proactively calls providers to secure accessibility and logs
confirmations. The existing **disruption / re-planning** machinery is kept but demoted to a
_possible future_ capability, not the MVP's headline flow.

The current app already has the right shape (agents, SSE, plugins). To be a real MVP,
promote each simulated fallback to a real integration behind the same interface:

1. **Real phone calls** — wire Vapi end-to-end (`server/agents/caller.ts` +
   `routes/vapi-webhook.ts`) with a public URL (ngrok/deploy). Keep the offline sim only
   as an automated-test path, not the demo path.
2. **Real reasoning** — require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for planner/extractor/vision; keep
   deterministic fallbacks for tests/CI only.
3. **Real data** — SNCF / Open-Meteo / Navitia plugins already pull live data; add real
   booking-source ingestion (parse an itinerary → structured steps) as the MVP entry point.
4. **Persistence** — replace `data/state.json` single-file store with a real store
   (SQLite via better-sqlite3, or Postgres) so multiple travelers/trips survive restarts.
5. **Auth & multi-tenant** — minimal login so a B2B operator sees only their portfolio
   (the fleet view already models this).
6. **Deploy target** — the MVP needs a Node host (Render/Fly/Railway) — _not_ static —
   because of Express + SSE + webhooks. Keep it separate from the demo's static deploy.

The MVP is out of scope for the demo deadline but the restructure keeps it a first-class
app so work continues cleanly.

---

## 6. Deployment

- **Demo → GitHub Pages (primary).** A workflow builds `apps/demo` with `--base=/AccessTrip/`
  and publishes `dist/` to `gh-pages`. No external account needed. **Vercel later (optional):**
  root `apps/demo`, `vite build` → `dist/`, `vercel.json` SPA rewrite, preview URL per PR —
  an easy switch if we want it.
- **MVP → Node host** (later): Render/Fly, env from `.env`, ngrok/public URL for Vapi
  webhooks.

---

## 7. Phased execution checklist

**Phase 0 — Assets & scripts (this turn, done)**

- [x] Phone dialogue scripts (`airport-call.json`, `hotel-call.json`).
- [x] Face-generation tooling (`generate-faces.ts` + `characters.json`).
- [x] Voice-generation tooling (`generate-voices.ts`, timing manifest).
- [x] This plan.

**Phase 1 — Workspace skeleton (no MVP move)**

- [x] Add `packages: ["apps/*"]` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; **leave `server`/`web`/`shared` at
      the root** (MVP stays the root package). Verify `pnpm test` still green. _(60/60 pass.)_
- [x] Scaffold `apps/demo` (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind) with its own `package.json` holding
      the animation deps; hello-world deploy to **GitHub Pages** (`--base=/AccessTrip/`).
      _(`.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml` builds + publishes `apps/demo/dist`.)_

**Phase 2 — Generate assets**

- [ ] Run both generators; review faces & listen to calls; tune prompts/voice settings.

**Phase 3 — Demo build (the "huge" part)**

- [x] Wire Lenis + GSAP (smooth scroll) + Framer Motion (`useScroll`/`whileInView`);
      build scenes 1–6 (`src/story/scenes/01-Hero`…`06-Outro`, assembled in `Story.tsx`).
- [x] Build `Phone`, `CallStage`, `Caption`, `Notification`, `useCallPlayer` (+ `Waveform`,
      `AudioControls`, `Chip`, `Reveal`, `Scene`). Waveform is a bespoke CSS-bar visual driven
      by the player rather than wavesurfer.js — one audio engine (Howler), no dual-decode sync.
- [x] Reduced-motion + keyboard + screen-reader passes: `useReducedMotion` gates every
      motion path, skip link + `:focus-visible` + semantic `section`/heading outline,
      `aria-live` captions, full DOM transcripts, alt text on every face. Typecheck + prod
      build green; assets serve 200 under `--base=/AccessTrip/`.
- [ ] Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95 — audit pending a real browser run.

**Phase 4 — MVP hardening** (post-demo) — section 5.

**Phase 5 — Ship**

- [ ] Demo live on Vercel; README updated with both apps; runbook refreshed for the new
      (proactive-setup) narrative.

## 8. Decisions (resolved 2026-07-04)

1. **Commit generated media → YES.** Faces + call audio are committed to the repo so the
   demo deploys and runs with zero keys and deterministic visuals. Generators stay in
   `tooling/demo` for regeneration; `apps/demo/public/{faces,audio}` are **not**
   gitignored.
2. **Demo language → French only.** French audio + French captions (persona-true). The
   transcript component stays language-agnostic so an EN track could be added later, but
   no bilingual toggle is built now.
3. **One repo, workspace not migration → YES.** pnpm workspace with `apps/demo` as an
   isolated member for dependency isolation; the **MVP stays at the repo root, unmoved**. No
   `apps/mvp` move and no `packages/shared` extraction now — both deferred post-hackathon.
4. **Narrative → initial reservation (proactive setup), for BOTH demo and MVP.** The agent
   secures accessibility before departure (calls airport + hotel). **Disruption / re-planning
   is kept but demoted to a possible future feature**, no longer the headline. Canonical
   vision lives in `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` symlinks to it).
5. **Demo hosting → GitHub Pages first.** No external account; Vercel considered later.
6. **`.env.example` → includes ElevenLabs** (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` + optional voice IDs).

**Status:** decisions above resolved 2026-07-04; docs (README + `docs/`) being brought in
line with the new narrative. Implementation of Phase 1 pending go-ahead.
